095 | start used Vuex

$npm install vuex

create store folder and store.js in it.

in store.js write:
import Vue from 'vue'
import Vuex from 'vuex'


// use vuex as plugin ex Vue.use(plugin name)
Vue.use(Vuex);

//  go create new store 
const store = new Vuex.Store({
  state: {
    counter: 0
  }
})

// export this store
export default store;

###
and in main.js import this store:

import store from './store/store'

new Vue({
  render: h => h(App),
  // add store here
  store
}).$mount('#app')

###
use store instead of [props, event]

in Counter.vue i will change this:

#1
props:['counter']
=--->
computed: {
    counter() {
        return this.$store.state.counter;
    }
},

#2
increase() { this.$emit('increase'); },
=--->
this.$store.state.counter++;

#3
decrease() { this.$emit('decrease'); }
=--->
this.$store.state.counter--;

###

also in CounterInfo.vue i will change this:

props: ['counter']
=--->
computed: {
    counter() {
        return this.$store.state.counter;
    }
},

###
also in App.vue i will change this:

#1 delete
<div id="app">
    <counter :counter="counter"
    v-on:increase="increase"
    v-on:decrease="decrease">
    </counter>

#2 delete
counter: 0

#3 delete
increase(){this.counter++;},
decrease(){this.counter--;}

###
also in Info.vue i will change this:

#1
<counter-info :counter="counter"></counter-info>
=--->
<counter-info></counter-info>

#2 delete
props: ['counter'],
----------------------------------
096 | Vuex Getters
Getters as state, but used with as method,


in store.js i will create getters:
getters: {
    doubledCounter(state) {
        return state.counter *2;
    }
}

###

use this getters in counter vue.js
computed: {
    doubledCounter() {
        return this.$store.getters.doubledCounter;
    }
},

###

passing parametters

#1 in store.js add this method
multiCounter: (state) => (yourNumber) => {
    return state.counter * yourNumber;
}

multiCounter: (state) => (yourNumber) => {
    return state.counter * yourNumber;
}

#2 in counter.vue call with number (3)
multiCounter() {
    return this.$store.getters.multiCounter(3);
}
